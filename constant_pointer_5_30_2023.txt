      int a = 10;
      int b = 20;

      //const int* p; pointer itself can change, but pointed to a variable cannot change
      
      //p = &a;

      //p = &b;

      //*p = 1;


      int* const p= &a;  pointer itself cannot change, but pointed to a variable can change

      p = &a;

      p = &b;
