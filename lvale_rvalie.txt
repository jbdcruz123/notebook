“l-value” refers to a memory location that
 identifies an object. “r-value” refers to the
  data value that is stored at some address 
  in memory. References in C++ are nothing
   but the alternative to the already existing
    variable. They are declared using the ‘&’
     before the name of the variable.

Example: 

int a = 10;

// Declaring lvalue reference
int& lref = a;

// Declaring rvalue reference
int&& rref = 20;
